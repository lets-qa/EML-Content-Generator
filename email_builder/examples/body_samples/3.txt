☕ Public Wi‑Fi: Free Internet, Free Headaches

Hello Digital Drifters,

Today’s topic is Public Wi‑Fi Security — or as hackers call it, “All-You-Can-Steal Data Buffet.”

Public Wi‑Fi is like free candy from a stranger:

It’s tempting.
It’s convenient.
And it might come with a side of regret.
Why Public Wi‑Fi is Risky:

Man-in-the-Middle Attacks — No, it’s not a wrestling move. It’s when a hacker intercepts your data between you and the internet.
Evil Twin Networks — Hackers set up a fake Wi‑Fi with a legit-sounding name like “Starbucks_Guest” (but it’s actually “Starbuks_Guest” — notice the missing ‘c’).
Unencrypted Traffic — If the site you’re visiting doesn’t use HTTPS, your data is basically being broadcast like a bad reality TV show.
How to Survive the Coffee Shop Jungle:

Use a VPN — It encrypts your traffic so hackers see gibberish instead of your bank login.
Turn off file sharing — Unless you want strangers to browse your vacation photos.
Avoid sensitive transactions — Public Wi‑Fi is not the place to do your taxes.
Forget the network after use — So your device doesn’t auto-connect later without asking.
Best Practice of the Week:
If you must use public Wi‑Fi, treat it like a public restroom: get in, do what you need to do, and get out — and for the love of all that is encrypted, wash your hands (digitally speaking).

Stay encrypted,
— Your Friendly Neighborhood Security Nerd 🦸‍♂️💻

P.S. If you see someone in a café with a hoodie, sunglasses, and a laptop covered in “root access” stickers… they might just be a security researcher. Or not. Don’t test it.
